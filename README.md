# AVX2 Optimized Impact Price Calculation for Crytocurrencies

## Overview

This project implements an **AVX2-optimized algorithm** for calculating impact prices in cryptocurrency order books, leveraging SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) intrinsics to significantly accelerate computations. The implementation draws inspiration from Stoikov's 2017 micro-price concept, adapting it for high-frequency trading scenarios in cryptocurrency markets.

Key features include:

1. **AVX2 Optimization**: Utilizes 256-bit vector operations for parallel processing of order book data.
2. **Dynamic CPU Feature Detection**: Automatically selects between AVX2 and scalar implementations based on runtime CPU capabilities.
3. **Cython Integration**: Combines Python's ease of use with C-level performance for optimal execution speed.
4. **Micro-Price Inspired Calculations**: Incorporates elements of Stoikov's micro-price, which accounts for order book imbalance and provides a potentially more accurate predictor of short-term price movements than traditional mid-price calculations

This implementation is particularly suited for high-frequency trading systems and market microstructure analysis in cryptocurrency markets, where rapid price calculations are crucial for making informed trading decisions

##  Performance

The AVX2 version can significantly speed up impact price computations in large order books.

| Order Book Size | Scalar (sec) | AVX2 (sec) | Speedup |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| 100             | 0.000010     | 0.000001   | \~6.67x |
| 1,000           | 0.000004     | 0.000001   | \~2.50x |
| 10,000          | 0.000009     | 0.000007   | \~1.16x |
| 1,000,000       | 0.010608     | 0.010793   | \~0.98x |
| 10,000,000      | 0.125414     | 0.127223   | \~0.99x |

## ðŸ›  Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.9+**, `pip`, and `Cython` installed:

```bash
pip install cython numpy
```

### Build the Cython Extension

Compile the AVX2 extension by running:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

##  Usage

### Run Benchmark Tests

Execute the benchmark to test performance:

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

Expected output:

```
[INFO] AVX2 Optimizations Enabled

Order Book Size: 100
  - Scalar Implementation: 0.000010 sec
  - AVX2 Implementation: 0.000001 sec (~6.67x speedup)
...
```

### Importing in Python

You can also import and use the function directly:

```python
import numpy as np
from benchmark_avx2 import impact_price, initialize_optimizations

initialize_optimizations()

order_book = np.random.rand(1000, 2) * 100  # Random price & volume
order_book = np.array(order_book, dtype=np.float64, order='C')
notional = 50000

price = impact_price(order_book, notional)
print(f"Impact Price: {price:.2f}")
```
